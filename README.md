  ## Usage 
  üíª
  
  A way to show off my front-end coding skills/DOM manipulation skills using JQuery and Bootstrap. The website consists of a single page with a navigation bar and various sections. Use the navigation links at the top to jump to different sections of the page.

  - Dark Mode and Light Mode
    To switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode, click on the "Dark/Light Mode" button located in the navigation bar. This button toggles the website's appearance between the two modes.

  - Products Section
    In the Products section, you'll find two rows of four items. Each item represents a product or placeholder content. Feel free to customize the content and images as per your needs.

  - Contact Us Section
    The Contact Us section includes three input fields for capturing user information. Use the fields to enter your name, email, and message. Submit the form to send the message.

  
  ## Future  
  ‚è©
  
  Some recommendations for future enhancements include:

  1. Responsive Design: Enhance the website's responsiveness to ensure optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes. Implement media queries and adapt the layout accordingly.

  2. Dynamic Content: Integrate a back-end server or API to fetch dynamic content for the products section. This allows for real-time updates and the ability to showcase actual product information.

  3. Improved Styling and Visuals: Refine the overall design, typography, and color scheme to create a more visually appealing and cohesive website. Consider incorporating animations and transitions to enhance user experience.

  4. Additional Sections: Expand the website by adding more sections such as testimonials, services, or a blog. This provides more comprehensive information and engages users with varied interests.

  5. Form Validation: Implement client-side form validation to ensure that user-entered data in the contact form meets the required criteria before submission. This helps improve data quality and user experience.

  6. Localization: Provide support for multiple languages to cater to a broader audience. Implement localization techniques to dynamically switch content based on user language preferences.

  7. Accessibility: Enhance the website's accessibility by following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. This includes providing alternative text for images, ensuring proper color contrast, and keyboard navigation support.
